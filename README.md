# Space Explorer

Space Explorer is a simple 2D game developed in Unity. It reinforces fundamental concepts like Unity Interface, Navigation, Game Object Manipulation, Transformation, Unity Component System, Scene Creation and Management, and introduces Physics and Colliders.

## Game Concept

In Space Explorer, the player pilots a spaceship through a dangerous asteroid field while collecting stars to earn points. The game creates a space-themed environment to enhance the player's experience of flying in space. The objective is to avoid asteroids while gathering as many stars as possible to achieve a high score.

## Features

- **Spaceship Control:** Control the spaceship with smooth and responsive input.
- **Asteroid Obstacles:** Dynamic and random asteroid generation to create challenging gameplay.
- **Star Collection:** Collect stars to earn points and increase your score.
- **Realistic Space Scene:** The game is designed with a realistic space environment, featuring stars, asteroids, and the vastness of space.
- **Physics and Colliders:** The game uses Unity's physics engine and colliders for realistic spaceship movement and collision detection.

## Game Mechanics

1. **Spaceship Movement:**
   - Use keyboard input (e.g., arrow keys or WASD) to navigate the spaceship through space.
   - Spaceship moves forward, left, and right with precise control.

2. **Asteroids:**
   - Asteroids spawn randomly from the top of the screen and move downward.
   - The player must avoid collisions with the asteroids to stay alive.

3. **Stars:**
   - Stars randomly appear on the screen for the player to collect.
   - Each collected star adds points to the player's score.

4. **Game Over:**
   - The game ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.
   - The player's final score is displayed, with an option to restart the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity Engine:** The game is built using Unity, utilizing its 2D features and component system.
- **C# Scripting:** Game logic and mechanics are implemented in C# scripts.
- **Physics Engine:** Unity's physics engine handles the asteroid collisions and spaceship movement.
- **Scene Management:** Different scenes (e.g., main menu, gameplay, game over) are created and managed.

## How to Play

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
2. **Open in Unity:** Open the project in Unity 2021.1.0 or above.
3. **Choose file and setting:** to export game click to "build"
4. **Play the Game:** Open game after export success

## Future Enhancements

- Add power-ups for the spaceship.
- Implement different difficulty levels.
- Introduce new obstacles and spaceship upgrades.
- Add a leaderboard for high scores.
